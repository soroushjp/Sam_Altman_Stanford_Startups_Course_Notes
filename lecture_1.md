Overview
========

* Four areas that matter
	- Idea
	- Product
	- Team
	- Execution
* Ideas do matter
	- Pivots work best when it's to an idea that the founders want for themselves
	- Bad ideas + Good execution = Sub optimal at best
	- Ideas come first, the startup second
* You will be working on an idea for **10 years**
* Long term thinking is rare in startups
	- Focus on a good kernel to begin with
* Best companies are *mission* focused
* Best ideas sound horrible at first
	- AirBnB
	- Facebook
* Sound crazy, be right.
* Aim to capture all of a small market, that is likely to grow to be used by everyone someday.
* Look at the market size in 10 years. Ignore what investors say here.
* The thing you control least is the market. So pick the right market.
* Why now? Why not 2 years ago? Why not 2 years from now?
* If you are not the customer for your product, you are at a big disadvantage. Only solution is to be as close to your customer as you possibly can.
* You should be able to explain idea in one sentence.
* What makes you different from out there? One big difference or completely different.
* Think about what people want first. What you want to build second.

Building a product
==============

* Talk to customers, build, exercise, sleep and eat. Rinse and repeat.
* Conferences, PR, even hiring etc. not important at first. These will be way easier if you build something people want, so do that first.
* Build something a small group of people love, not something a lot of people like
* A great product is the secret to long term growth. Multiplier on everything else.
* Great founders don't put anyone between themselves and their users. Don't hire sales or customer service people.
* Employees build what the CEO measures -- registrations, active users, cohort retention, revenue, net promoter scores. Focus on growth.

Why you should start a startup w/ Dustin Moskovitz
=======================================

* Common reasons: Glamorous, your own boss, flexibility, $$$
* Entrepreneurship is much more stressful than people think -- Economist article, Entrepreneur's Anonymous
	- http://www.economist.com/news/business/21618816-instead-romanticising-entrepreneurs-people-should-understand-how-hard-their-lives-can
* A lot of responsibility - fear of failure for yourself *and for your employees*
* Always on call - startup doesn't stop when you go on holiday
* It's not glamorous parties or huge epiphanies -- it's hard work day after day
* You're much more committed. You can't just quit like a regular job. Leaving is a big deal as a cofounder. 5 years commitment if doesn't go well. 10 years if it is going well.
* No. 1 job of a CEO - managing your own psychology.
* Being your own boss sounds pretty nice. Reality is that no one has more bosses than a CEO -- every employee, every customer, every investor, every partner. "The life of most entrepreneurs is reporting to everyone else" - Phil Libin, CEO Evernote
* Flexibility sounds pretty nice. Reality: "You'll be able to work any 24 hours a day you want!" - Phil Libin, CEO Evernote. Hyper growth startups take a ridiculous amount of work and you are the role model for the rest of the company.
* Financial reward sounds pretty nice. Beware. Facebook's 100th employee made $200mn. Dropbox's 100th made $10mn. If you own 10% of a $100mn or even $2bn company, you could come out at the same financial reward as the 100th employee of a hypergrowth startup.
* You can make a massive impact as an employee instead of as a founder. 1500th employee of Google made Google Maps, which everyone uses. Plenty of similar examples.

* So what's the best reason??? -- **You can't not do it**
* *Passion* -- you will go through all of these struggles to do it. You're passion will cause other people to join you in your mission.
* *Aptitude* -- the world needs you to do it. The world needs **it** and the world needs **you**. Find what people want and why you're the person to do it.
